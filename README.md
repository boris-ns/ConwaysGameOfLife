# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life implementation in p5.js. <br />
Everything you need to know about Conway's game of life you can check out here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>. <br />
To run this simulation just open index.html or see live preview. <br />
If you want to change some parameters, they are at the top of 'main.js' file. <br />
I implemented edge cases as wrap-around grid. So if the cell is at top, top neighbour will be at bottom of the grid and vice-versa. Same goes for cells that are on left or right edge.
